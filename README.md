# NoMoreChars

Hello Everyone,
I did this mini project because I need a tool to solve a real life job issue.

Why I created it:
The tool used in my work had a text field were always you copy the information and paste anywhere, the text always came with more break lines than needed.
Example:
"1. This is the first information
2. This is the second information"

So if you copy from the system, when you paste it, this is the result:

"1. This is the first information

2. This is the second information"

So I created this site where the original code remove the extra break line in the text and you can paste as original form, since we can not use external tools.

So I add a text box where you can choose the character that you want to delete.

How to use:

You just need to paste the text that you want in the big text box and write the character that you want in the little text box.
So click in button to copy the correct text in your Ctrl+V.

Thanks ðŸ˜€
